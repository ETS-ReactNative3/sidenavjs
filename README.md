Sidenav.js is a React component that enables users add left side navigation to their web site that behaves like a native side navigation component of an Android application. **No dependencies!** Only *3K* when minified and gzipped!
Open Google Play Store and swipe your finger from the left of the screen. This library tries to provide the exact same behaviour.

yarn add sidenavjs
```

## Usage (minimum required variables)

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import Sidenav from 'sidenavjs'

class Example extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      sidebarOpen: false
    }
  }

  onSetSidebarOpen = open => {
    this.setState({ sidebarOpen: open })
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <Sidenav
        open={this.state.sidebarOpen}
        onSetOpen={this.onSetSidebarOpen}
        sidenav={
          <div>sidenav contents</div>
        }
      >
        <div>
          body contents
          <button onClick={() => { this.onSetSidebarOpen(true) }}>
            Click here to open the sidenav
          </button>
        </div>
      </Sidenav>
    )
  }
}
```

## Features
1. Mobile first. Means: The library is small and robust, optimized for fluidity and framerate.
2. Multi-finger handled. Means: We won't confuse your fingers and throw bunch of exceptions if you
touch with more then one finger.
3. You can open/close sidenav programmatically. (By binding it to a button.)
4. You can attach callback to learn if user is touching the sidenav.
5. You can attach callback to learn if an animation in progress or not.
6. Sidenav contains only a minimal CSS bundled with it: You can add your custom classes and styles to make the styling perfect.
